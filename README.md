# Generative Dog Images with BigGan

This is the project for the course of Vision and Perception (A.Y. 2019/2020). 
The project consists in implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image generation, specifically for dog image generation.

## Project

We implemented two different types of GAN:
- a simpler **DCGAN**, based on the architecture presented in [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434);
- a more complex **BigGAN**, based on the architecture presented in [Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096).

The project implementation has been done on Colab, using TensorFlow. All the code used is accessible on a copy of the [Colab notebook](notebooks/Project.ipynb).
